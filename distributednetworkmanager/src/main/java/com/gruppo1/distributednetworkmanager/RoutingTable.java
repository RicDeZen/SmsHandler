/**
 * @author Niccolo' Turcato
 * Structure for a container that realizes the routing table described by Kademlia P2P algorithm
 * It is built using as base Node, the Peer that builds the object. So each peer of the network has its own
 *
 * Given an integer N: number of bit that compose the address space for the network's Nodes
 *
 * The RoutingTable contains N Bucket(of a defined dimension)
 * i: is the index of a Bucket (between 0 and N-1)
 *
 * The bucket of index i contains the Nodes that have distance (ORX metric) >= 2^(N-i-1) <= 2^(N-i)-1
 *
 * i.e.
 *
 * if(i = 0)
 *      bit[0] = NOT(myself[0])
 *      bit[0, N-1] = any
 *
 * if(i > 0 && i < N-1)
 *      bit[N-1, N-i] = myself[N-1, N-i]
 *      bit[N-(i+1)] = NOT(myself[N-(i+1)]
 *      bit[N-(i+2), 0] = myself[N-(i+2), 0]
 *
 * if(i = N-1)
 *      bit[N-1] = NOT(myself[0])
 *      bit[0, N-1] = myself[0, N-1]
 *      the only Node that has distance = 1
